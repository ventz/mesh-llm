This file covers local build and development workflows for this repository.

## Prerequisites

- `just`
- `cmake`
- Rust toolchain (`cargo`)
- Node.js 24 + npm (for UI development)

**macOS**: Apple Silicon. Metal is used automatically.

**Linux NVIDIA**: x86_64 with an NVIDIA GPU. Requires the CUDA toolkit (`nvcc` in your `PATH`). On Arch Linux, CUDA is typically at `/opt/cuda`; on Ubuntu/Debian it's at `/usr/local/cuda`. Auto-detection finds the right SM architecture for your GPU.

**Linux AMD**: ROCm/HIP is supported when ROCm is installed. Typical installs expose `hipcc`, `hipconfig`, and `rocm-smi` under `/opt/rocm/bin`.

**Linux Vulkan**: Vulkan is supported when the Vulkan development files and `glslc` are installed. On Ubuntu/Debian, install `libvulkan-dev glslc`. On Arch Linux, install `vulkan-headers shaderc`.

**Windows**: `just build` auto-detects `cuda`, `hip`/`rocm`, `vulkan`, or `cpu`. You can override with `just build backend=cuda` (or `rocm`, `vulkan`, `cpu`). Metal is not supported on Windows.

## Build from source

Build everything (patched llama.cpp, mesh binary, and UI production build):

```bash
just build
```

On Linux, `just build` auto-detects CUDA vs ROCm vs Vulkan. For NVIDIA, make sure `nvcc` is in your `PATH` first:

```bash
# Arch Linux
PATH=/opt/cuda/bin:$PATH just build

# Ubuntu/Debian
PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH just build
```

For NVIDIA builds, the script auto-detects your GPU's CUDA architecture. To override:

```bash
just build cuda_arch=90   # e.g. H100
```

For AMD ROCm builds, you can force the backend explicitly:

```bash
just build backend=rocm
```

To override the AMD GPU target list:

```bash
just build backend=rocm rocm_arch="gfx90a;gfx942;gfx1100"
```

For Vulkan builds, force the backend explicitly:

```bash
just build backend=vulkan
```

For CPU-only builds (no GPU acceleration):

```bash
just build backend=cpu
```

On Windows, you can override the detected backend if needed:

```powershell
just build backend=vulkan
just build backend=cpu
just build backend=cuda cuda_arch=90
```

Windows release bundles use dedicated Windows release recipes:

```powershell
just release-build-cuda-windows
just release-bundle-cuda-windows v0.X.0
```

GitHub Actions uses hosted `windows-2022` runners for compile-only Windows CI. The release workflow keeps the Windows release build/publish block commented out for now, so Windows release packaging is currently local-only via the `*-windows` `just` recipes above.

Create a portable bundle:

```bash
just bundle
```

## UI development workflow

Use this two-terminal flow for UI development.

Terminal A (run `mesh-llm` yourself):

```bash
mesh-llm --port 9337 --console 3131
```

If `mesh-llm` is not on your `PATH`:

```bash
./target/release/mesh-llm --port 9337 --console 3131
```

Terminal B (run Vite with HMR):

```bash
just ui-dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

`ui-dev` defaults:

- Serves on `127.0.0.1:5173`
- Proxies `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:3131`

Overrides:

```bash
# Different backend API origin for /api proxy
just ui-dev http://127.0.0.1:4141

# Different Vite dev port
just ui-dev http://127.0.0.1:3131 5174
```

## Useful commands

```bash
just stop             # stop mesh/rpc/llama processes
just test             # quick test against :9337
just check-release    # release-target/docs/workflow parity check
just compat-smoke ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/<model>.gguf   # optional 2-node + 1-client Python/Node/LiteLLM smoke
just --list           # list all recipes
```

On native Windows, `just check-release` runs the host-safe Rust/doc invariant subset and skips the Bash-only `install.sh` / `package-release.sh` parity checks. Run it on macOS or Linux when you need full shell parity coverage.

## CI / GitHub Actions

CI uses [`dorny/paths-filter`](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter) to skip jobs when unchanged areas of the repo are modified. A `changes` detection job runs first on every push and PR, then each build job gates on its output.

For the repo's CI design rules and workflow responsibilities, see [`docs/CI_GUIDANCE.md`](docs/CI_GUIDANCE.md).

### Verifying path filtering works

To confirm builds are skipped on a docs-only change, open a PR and push a commit that touches only a `.md` file (e.g. add a blank line to `README.md`). All build jobs should appear as **Skipped** in the Actions tab — only the `changes` job runs.

To confirm UI-only changes skip the GPU backend jobs, push a commit touching only `crates/mesh-llm/ui/**`. The `linux` and `macos` jobs run; `linux_cuda`, `linux_rocm`, `linux_vulkan`, and `windows` are skipped.

### Adding new paths

If you add a new Rust crate, build script, or test directory, add its path to the `rust` filter in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` under the `changes` job so it correctly triggers the build matrix.

## Benchmark Binaries

Memory bandwidth benchmark source files live in `crates/mesh-llm/benchmarks/`. These are optional — they are **not** compiled by `just build`. Each target platform requires its own toolchain.

### Building

```bash
just benchmark-build-apple    # macOS Apple Silicon — requires swiftc (ships with Xcode)
just benchmark-build-cuda     # NVIDIA GPU — requires CUDA toolkit (nvcc)
just benchmark-build-hip      # AMD GPU — requires ROCm (hipcc)
just benchmark-build-intel    # Intel Arc GPU — requires Intel oneAPI (icpx) — UNVALIDATED
```

On Windows, use the dedicated recipes:

```powershell
just benchmark-build-cuda-windows
just benchmark-build-hip-windows
just benchmark-build-intel-windows
```

These produce `.exe` binaries next to `mesh-llm.exe`.

> **AMD note:** The AMD benchmark (`crates/mesh-llm/benchmarks/membench-fingerprint.hip`) has not been tested on real AMD hardware. The recipe is provided for reference only.

> **Intel Arc note:** The Intel Arc benchmark (`crates/mesh-llm/benchmarks/membench-fingerprint-intel.cpp`) has not been tested on real Intel Arc hardware. The recipe is provided for reference only.

### Output location

All recipes output to `target/release/`, the same directory as the `mesh-llm` binary. The `detect_bin_dir()` function in `mesh-llm` probes that directory at runtime, so benchmark binaries are discovered automatically.

### Including in release bundles (Apple Silicon)

The `just bundle` recipe automatically includes `membench-fingerprint` if it has been built:

```bash
just benchmark-build-apple && just bundle
```

If the binary is not present, `just bundle` prints a note and continues without it — the bundle is still valid.

CUDA, HIP, and Intel binaries are **not** included in the Unix tarball bundle; they must be compiled on the target platform.
On Windows release packaging, any `membench-fingerprint*.exe` binaries present in `target/release/` are included automatically in the generated `.zip`.

## Protocol Backward Compatibility

Any change to `crates/mesh-llm/src/protocol/` or `crates/mesh-client/src/protocol/` requires backward-compatibility tests before merging.

Embedded clients (iOS, macOS, Android) are permanently supported. Protocol changes that break embedded client compatibility are breaking changes.

Run the protocol compatibility tests after any protocol change:

```bash
cargo test -p mesh-llm --test protocol_compat_v0_client
cargo test -p mesh-llm --test protocol_convert_matrix
```

See [`docs/design/EMBEDDED_CLIENT_ADR.md`](docs/design/EMBEDDED_CLIENT_ADR.md) for the full compatibility policy and rationale.
