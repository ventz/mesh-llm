# Mesh LLM

Mesh LLM lets you pool spare GPU capacity across machines and expose the result as one OpenAI-compatible API.

If a model fits on one machine, it runs there. If it does not, Mesh LLM automatically spreads the work across the mesh:

- Dense models use pipeline parallelism.
- MoE models use expert sharding with zero cross-node inference traffic.
- Models collaborate during inference — a text-only model consults a vision peer, an uncertain model gets a second opinion from a different architecture.
- Every node gets the same local API at `http://localhost:9337/v1`.

## Why people use it

- Run models larger than a single machine can hold.
- Turn a few uneven boxes into one shared inference pool.
- Give agents a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint instead of wiring each tool by hand.
- Keep the setup simple: start one node, add more later.

## Quick start

Install the latest release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then start a node:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --auto
```

Inspect local GPU identity:

```bash
mesh-llm gpus
```

That command:

- picks a suitable bundled backend for your machine
- downloads a model if needed
- joins the best public mesh
- exposes an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://localhost:9337/v1`
- starts the web console at `http://localhost:3131`

Use `--headless` to disable the embedded web console while keeping the management API (`/api/*`) available on the `--console` port. This is useful for headless server deployments where the UI is not needed.

Check what is available:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9337/v1/models | jq '.data[].id'
```

Send a request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9337/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"GLM-4.7-Flash-Q4_K_M","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

## Common workflows

### 1. Try the public mesh

```bash
mesh-llm serve --auto
```

This is the easiest way to see the system working end to end.

### 2. Start a private mesh

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B
```

This starts serving a model, opens the local API and console, and prints an invite token for other machines.

### 3. Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm
cd mesh-llm
just build
```

Requires: `just`, `cmake`, Rust toolchain, Node.js 24 + npm. NVIDIA GPU builds need `nvcc` (CUDA toolkit). AMD GPU builds need ROCm/HIP. Vulkan GPU builds need the Vulkan development files plus `glslc`. CPU-only and Jetson/Tegra also work. For source builds, `just build` auto-detects CUDA vs ROCm vs Vulkan on Linux, or you can force `backend=rocm` or `backend=vulkan`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Windows source builds are also supported for `cuda`, `rocm`/`hip`, `vulkan`, and `cpu` via `just build`. Metal remains macOS-only. Tagged stable GitHub releases publish macOS bundles plus Linux CPU, Linux ARM64 CPU, Linux CUDA, Linux ROCm, and Linux Vulkan bundles. Prereleases use the same workflow and can optionally skip the Linux CUDA, Linux ROCm, and Linux Vulkan bundles. The Linux ARM64 CPU artifact is `mesh-llm-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`. In install and release contexts, `arm64` and `aarch64` mean the same 64-bit ARM target, and generic 32-bit ARM is not a published release target. Windows publish jobs are currently commented out in `.github/workflows/release.yml`, but you can still generate the matching local Windows artifacts with `just release-build-windows`, `just release-build-cuda-windows`, `just release-build-rocm-windows`, `just release-build-vulkan-windows`, and the matching `release-bundle-*-windows` recipes.

## Run
Once installed, you can run:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --auto                      # join the best public mesh, start serving
```

That's it. Downloads a model for your hardware, connects to other nodes, and gives you an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://localhost:9337`.

Or start your own:
```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B        # downloads model (~20GB), starts API + web console
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-3B         # or a small model first (~2GB)
```

Add another machine:
```bash
mesh-llm serve --join <token>              # token printed by the first machine
```

Or discover and join public meshes:
```bash
mesh-llm serve --auto                      # find and join the best mesh
mesh-llm client --auto                     # join as API-only client (no GPU)
```

## Output

`mesh-llm` has two terminal output modes:

- `--log-format pretty` renders human-readable output. In `serve` on an interactive TTY, this becomes the full dashboard; otherwise it falls back to line-oriented pretty output.
- `--log-format json` writes newline-delimited JSON records to `stdout`, which keeps it safe for `jq`, log shippers, and shell pipelines.

JSON mode example:

```json
{"timestamp":"...","level":"info","event":"llama_ready","model":"Qwen3-32B","port":8001,"ctx_size":8192,"message":"Qwen3-32B ready on internal port 8001"}
{"timestamp":"...","level":"info","event":"model_ready","model":"Qwen3-32B","port":38373,"internal_port":38373,"role":"host","message":"model Qwen3-32B ready on port 38373"}
{"timestamp":"...","level":"info","event":"ready","api_url":"http://localhost:9337","console_url":"http://localhost:3131","api_port":9337,"console_port":3131,"models_count":2,"message":"mesh-llm runtime ready"}
```

Line-oriented pretty sessions accept these commands after startup is ready:

- `h` shows help
- `i` prints the current mesh status snapshot
- `q` quits cleanly

For the full event taxonomy and field reference, see [crates/mesh-llm/src/cli/output/EVENTS.md](crates/mesh-llm/src/cli/output/EVENTS.md).

## How it works

Every node gets an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://localhost:9337/v1`. Distribution is automatic — you just say `mesh-llm serve --model X` and the mesh figures out the best strategy:

- **Model fits on one machine?** → runs solo, full speed, no network overhead
- **Dense model too big?** → pipeline parallelism — layers split across nodes
- **MoE model too big?** → expert parallelism — experts split across nodes, zero cross-node traffic

If a node has enough VRAM, it always runs the full model. Splitting only happens when it has to.
Currently using upstream llama.cpp with a pinned Mesh-LLM patch queue; see [docs/design/LLAMA_CPP_FORK.md](docs/design/LLAMA_CPP_FORK.md).

**Pipeline parallelism** — for dense models that don't fit on one machine, layers are distributed across nodes proportional to VRAM. llama-server runs on the highest-VRAM node and coordinates via RPC. Each rpc-server loads only its assigned layers from local disk. Latency-aware: peers are selected by lowest RTT first, with an 80ms hard cap — high-latency nodes stay in the mesh as API clients but don't participate in splits.

**MoE expert parallelism** — Mixture-of-Experts models (Qwen3-MoE, GLM, OLMoE, Mixtral, DeepSeek — increasingly the best-performing architectures) are auto-detected from the GGUF header. The mesh reads expert routing statistics to identify which experts matter most, then assigns each node an overlapping shard: a shared core of critical experts replicated everywhere, plus unique experts distributed across nodes. Each node gets a standalone GGUF with the full trunk + its expert subset and runs its own independent llama-server — zero cross-node traffic during inference. Sessions are hash-routed to nodes for KV cache locality.

**Multi-model** — different nodes serve different models simultaneously. The API proxy peeks at the `model` field in each request and routes to the right node via QUIC tunnel. `/v1/models` lists everything available.

**Demand-aware rebalancing** — a unified demand map tracks which models the mesh wants (from `--model` flags, API requests, and gossip). Demand signals propagate infectiously across all nodes and decay naturally via TTL. Standby nodes auto-promote to serve unserved models with active demand, or rebalance when one model is significantly hotter than others. When a model loses its last server, standby nodes detect it within ~60s.

**Inter-model collaboration** — models on the mesh help each other during inference. When a text-only model receives an image, it silently consults a vision model on the mesh for a caption and generates from that. When a small model is uncertain, it races two peers for a second opinion and injects the winner's answer as context. When a model gets stuck in a repetition loop, another model nudges it out. The caller sees one seamless response — they don't know multiple models collaborated. Inspired by [Mixture of Models (NSED)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16863) — the mesh is the ensemble. See [VIRTUAL_LLM.md](docs/design/VIRTUAL_LLM.md).

**Latency design** — the key insight is that HTTP streaming is latency-tolerant while RPC is latency-multiplied. llama-server always runs on the same box as the GPU. The mesh tunnels HTTP, so cross-network latency only affects time-to-first-token, not per-token throughput. RPC only crosses the network for pipeline splits where the model physically doesn't fit on one machine.

### Network optimizations

- **Zero-transfer GGUF loading** — `SET_TENSOR_GGUF` tells rpc-server to read weights from local disk. Dropped model load from 111s → 5s.
- **RPC round-trip reduction** — cached `get_alloc_size`, skip GGUF lookups for intermediates. Per-token round-trips: 558 → 8.
- **Direct server-to-server transfers** — intermediate tensors pushed directly between rpc-servers via TCP, not relayed through the client.
- **Speculative decoding** — draft model runs locally on the host, proposes tokens verified in one batched forward pass. +38% throughput on code (75% acceptance).

## Usage

### Start a mesh
```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B
```
Starts serving a model and prints an invite token. This mesh is **private** — only people you share the token with can join.

To make it **public** (discoverable by others via `--auto`):
```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B --publish
```

### Join a mesh
```bash
mesh-llm serve --join <token>              # join with invite token (GPU node)
mesh-llm client --join <token>             # join as API-only client (no GPU)
```

### Named mesh (buddy mode)
```bash
mesh-llm serve --auto --model GLM-4.7-Flash-Q4_K_M --mesh-name "poker-night" --publish
```
Everyone runs the same command. First person creates it, everyone else discovers "poker-night" and joins automatically. Use `--publish` to make your named mesh discoverable on Nostr; without it the mesh is private but still joinable via invite token.

### Auto-discover
```bash
mesh-llm serve --auto                      # discover, join, and serve a model
mesh-llm client --auto                     # join as API-only client (no GPU)
mesh-llm discover                          # browse available meshes
mesh-llm gpus                              # inspect local GPUs and stable IDs
```

### Inspect and clean the shared model cache
```bash
mesh-llm models installed
mesh-llm models cleanup --unused-since 30d
mesh-llm models cleanup --unused-since 30d --yes
```

`models installed` now shows whether a cached model is mesh-managed or external plus the last time mesh-llm used it. `models cleanup` only removes model files that mesh-llm explicitly marked as mesh-managed; by default it prints a dry run preview and requires `--yes` to delete anything.

### Multi-model
```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B --model GLM-4.7-Flash

# Route by model name
curl localhost:9337/v1/chat/completions -d '{"model":"GLM-4.7-Flash-Q4_K_M", ...}'
```
Different nodes serve different models. The API proxy routes by the `model` field.

### Inspect local GPUs
```bash
mesh-llm gpus
mesh-llm gpus --json
mesh-llm gpu benchmark --json
```

`mesh-llm gpus` prints local GPU entries, backend device names, stable IDs, VRAM, unified-memory state, and cached bandwidth when a benchmark fingerprint is already available. Add `--json` for machine-readable inventory output, or run `mesh-llm gpu benchmark --json` to refresh the local fingerprint and print the benchmark result as JSON.

Use only pinnable `Stable ID` / `stable_id` values from `mesh-llm gpus` or `mesh-llm gpus --json` for pinned startup config. Stable-ID fallback values such as `index:*` or backend-device names like `CUDA0` / `HIP0` / `MTL0` can still be printed for inventory purposes, but they are not valid pin targets.

### Startup config

`mesh-llm serve` can now load startup models from `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml`:

```toml
version = 1

[gpu]
assignment = "pinned"

[[models]]
model = "Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M"
gpu_id = "pci:0000:65:00.0"

[[models]]
model = "bartowski/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-GGUF/qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf"
mmproj = "bartowski/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-GGUF/mmproj-f16.gguf"
ctx_size = 8192
gpu_id = "uuid:GPU-12345678"

[[plugin]]
name = "blackboard"
enabled = true
```

Start with the default config path:

```bash
mesh-llm serve
```

If no startup models are configured, `mesh-llm serve` prints a `⚠️` warning, shows help, and exits.

Or point at a different file:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --config /path/to/config.toml
```

Precedence rules:

- Explicit `--model` or `--gguf` ignores configured `[[models]]`.
- Explicit `--ctx-size` overrides configured `ctx_size` for the selected startup models.
- Plugin entries still live in the same file.

Pinned startup notes:

- `assignment = "pinned"` requires every configured `[[models]]` entry to include a `gpu_id`.
- Valid `gpu_id` values come from the pinnable stable IDs reported by `mesh-llm gpus` / `mesh-llm gpus --json`, not fallback inventory IDs.
- Pinned configs fail closed when a configured ID is missing, ambiguous, unsupported on the local backend, or no longer resolves on the current machine.
- Explicit `--model` / `--gguf` still bypass configured `[[models]]`, so they also bypass config-owned pinned `gpu_id` values.

### No-arg behavior
```bash
mesh-llm                                   # no args — prints --help and exits
```
Does not start the console or bind any ports. Use the CLI flags shown in `--help` to start or join a mesh.

## Background service

To install it as a per-user background service:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --service
```

Service installs are user-scoped:

- macOS installs a `launchd` agent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mesh-llm.mesh-llm.plist`
- Linux installs a `systemd --user` unit at `~/.config/systemd/user/mesh-llm.service`
- Shared environment config lives in `~/.config/mesh-llm/service.env`
- Startup models live in `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml`

The two platforms handle launch startup the same way:

- macOS: `launchd` runs `~/.config/mesh-llm/run-service.sh`, which loads `service.env` and executes `mesh-llm serve`.
- Linux: the installer writes `mesh-llm serve` directly into `ExecStart=` in `~/.config/systemd/user/mesh-llm.service`.

The background service no longer stores custom startup args. Configure startup models in `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml` instead.

`service.env` is optional and shared by both platforms. Use plain `KEY=value` lines, for example:

```text
MESH_LLM_NO_SELF_UPDATE=1
```

If you edit the Linux unit manually, reload and restart it:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart mesh-llm.service
```

On Linux this is a user service, so if you want it to keep running after reboot before login, enable lingering once:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

## Web console

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B    # dashboard at http://localhost:3131
```

Live topology, per-node GPU capacity, model picker, and built-in chat. Live members show only the `Client`, `Standby`, `Loading`, and `Serving` badges. Wakeable provider-backed capacity is shown separately from topology and stays out of routing until it rejoins. Everything comes from `/api/status` (JSON) and `/api/events` (SSE).

## Multimodal Support

mesh-llm supports multimodal requests on:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/responses`

The console supports image, audio, and file attachments. Large attachments use request-scoped blob upload rather than permanent storage.

### Current support matrix

| Family / model type | Vision | Audio | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Qwen3-VL`, `Qwen3VL` | yes | no | Example: `Qwen3VL-2B-Instruct-Q4_K_M` |
| `Qwen2-VL`, `Qwen2.5-VL` | yes | no | Vision-capable Qwen VL families |
| `LLaVA`, `mllama`, `PaliGemma`, `Idefics`, `Molmo`, `InternVL`, `GLM-4V`, `Ovis`, `Florence` | yes | no | Detected as vision-capable families |
| `Qwen2-Audio` | no | yes | Audio-capable family |
| `SeaLLM-Audio` | no | yes | Audio-capable family |
| `Ultravox` | no | yes | Audio-capable family |
| `Omni` | no or metadata-dependent | yes | Example: `Qwen2.5-Omni-3B-Q4_K_M` |
| `Whisper` | no | yes | Audio-capable family |
| Any GGUF with `mmproj` sidecar | yes | depends | Strong local signal for vision support |
| Any model with `vision_config` / vision token IDs | yes | depends | Promoted by metadata |
| Any model with `audio_config` / audio token IDs | depends | yes | Promoted by metadata |
| Generic `multimodal`, `-vl`, `image`, `video`, `voice` naming only | likely | likely | Hint only, not a strong routing guarantee |

Notes:

- `yes` means mesh-llm treats the model as runtime-capable for routing and UI.
- `likely` means mesh-llm shows a weaker hint but does not rely on it as a hard capability.
- Mixed image+audio requests work only when the selected model/runtime actually supports both modalities.
- Non-goals: `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`, `POST /v1/audio/speech`, and `v1/realtime`.

For the full capability and transport details, see [docs/design/MULTI_MODAL.md](docs/design/MULTI_MODAL.md).

### Development

Build-from-source and UI development instructions are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Using with agents

mesh-llm exposes an OpenAI-compatible API on `localhost:9337`. Any tool that supports custom OpenAI endpoints works. `/v1/models` lists available models; the `model` field in requests routes to the right node.

For built-in launcher integrations (`goose`, `claude`, `opencode`):

- Goose and Claude reuse a local mesh on `--port` and auto-start a local client if needed.
- OpenCode targets `--host` (default `127.0.0.1:9337`) and only auto-starts a local client for loopback/localhost targets.
- If `--model` is omitted, the launcher picks the strongest tool-capable model available on the mesh.
- When the harness exits (e.g. `claude` quits), the auto-started node is cleaned up automatically.

### goose

[Goose](https://github.com/block/goose) is available as both CLI (`goose session`) and desktop app (Goose.app).

```bash
mesh-llm goose
```

Use a specific model (example: MiniMax):

```bash
mesh-llm goose --model MiniMax-M2.5-Q4_K_M
```

This command writes/updates `~/.config/goose/custom_providers/mesh.json` and launches Goose.

### opencode

OpenCode uses a temporary provider config injected by Mesh, so you don't need to edit local config files by hand. For the full advanced or manual setup, see [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md).

```bash
mesh-llm opencode
```

Point OpenCode at a different mesh host or URL:

```bash
mesh-llm opencode --host https://mesh.example.com
```

Use a specific model (example: MiniMax):

```bash
mesh-llm opencode --host 127.0.0.1:9337 --model MiniMax-M2.5-Q4_K_M
```

Write or update a merged persistent OpenCode config:

```bash
mesh-llm opencode --write --host 127.0.0.1:9337
```

### pi

1. Start a mesh client:
```bash
mesh-llm client --auto --port 9337
```

2. Check what models are available:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9337/v1/models | jq '.data[].id'
```

### External OpenAI-compatible backends (vLLM, TGI, Ollama, Lemonade, etc.)

The `openai-endpoint` plugin routes inference to any server that speaks the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` API. The server does all the inference work — mesh-llm just discovers its models and routes requests to it.

Enable the plugin in `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml` with the URL:

```toml
# vLLM
[[plugin]]
name = "openai-endpoint"
url = "http://gpu-box:8000/v1"

# Ollama
[[plugin]]
name = "openai-endpoint"
url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"

# Lemonade
[[plugin]]
name = "openai-endpoint"
url = "http://localhost:8000/api/v1"
```

```bash
mesh-llm serve
```

The URL can also be set via `MESH_LLM_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_URL` env var (config takes precedence). Default: `http://localhost:8000/v1`. The plugin health-checks the backend by probing `GET /v1/models` — models appear and disappear automatically as the backend starts and stops.

To use an external backend without loading any llama.cpp models:

```bash
mesh-llm client
```

If you want the mesh to be discoverable via `--auto`, publish it:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B --publish
```

### 3. Add another machine

```bash
mesh-llm serve --join <token>
```

Use `mesh-llm client` if the machine should join without serving a model:

```bash
mesh-llm client --join <token>
```

### 4. Create a named mesh for a group

```bash
mesh-llm serve --auto --model GLM-4.7-Flash-Q4_K_M --mesh-name "poker-night" --publish
```

Everyone runs the same command. The first node creates the mesh, the rest discover and join it automatically. Use `--publish` so your named mesh appears in Nostr discovery; without it you must share the invite token manually.

### 5. Serve more than one model

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B --model GLM-4.7-Flash
```

Requests are routed by the `model` field:

```bash
curl localhost:9337/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"GLM-4.7-Flash-Q4_K_M","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

## How it works

Mesh LLM keeps the user-facing surface simple: talk to `localhost:9337`, pick a model, and let the mesh decide how to serve it.

- If a model fits on one machine, it runs there with no network overhead.
- If a dense model does not fit, layers are split across low-latency peers.
- If an MoE model does not fit, experts are split across nodes and requests are hash-routed for cache locality.
- Different nodes can serve different models at the same time.

Each node also exposes a management API and web console on port `3131`.

## Install notes

The installer currently targets macOS and Linux release bundles. Windows coming soon.

To force a specific bundled flavor during install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh | MESH_LLM_INSTALL_FLAVOR=vulkan bash
```

Installed release bundles use flavor-specific llama.cpp binaries:

- macOS: `metal`
- Linux: `cpu`, `cuda` (primary CUDA lane, built on the CUDA 12.6.3 toolkit; compatible with NVIDIA R535+ drivers; sm_75..sm_90 Turing–Hopper), `cuda-blackwell` (Blackwell lane, built on the CUDA 12.8 toolkit; requires R550+ drivers; adds sm_100/120 — sm_103 is a later CUDA release), `rocm`, `vulkan`
- Linux ARM64 CPU: `cpu` (asset triple: `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`)

For release and install naming, `arm64` and `aarch64` both refer to the same 64-bit ARM target. Generic 32-bit ARM is not a published release target.

To update a bundle install to the latest release:

```bash
mesh-llm update
```

To install a specific bundled release tag:

```bash
mesh-llm update --version v0.X.Y
```

If you build from source, always use `just`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm
cd mesh-llm
just build
```

Requirements and backend-specific build notes are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Web console

When a node is running, open:

```text
http://localhost:3131
```

The console shows live topology with only `Client`, `Standby`, `Loading`, and `Serving` badges for live members, plus separate wakeable capacity, VRAM usage, loaded models, and built-in chat. Wakeable inventory is not part of topology peers or routing until it rejoins. It is backed by `/api/status` and `/api/events`.

To run without the embedded UI (for example, in a headless server environment), pass `--headless`:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-3B --headless
```

In headless mode, the web console routes (`/`, `/dashboard`, `/chat`) return 404. The management API (`/api/*`) stays fully available on the `--console` port.
