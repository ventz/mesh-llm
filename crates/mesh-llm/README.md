# mesh-llm crate

Rust implementation of mesh-llm: a peer-to-peer control plane for llama.cpp inference over QUIC, with distributed routing, model orchestration, plugin hosting, and a local management API.

For install and end-user usage, see the [project README](../../README.md). For deeper architecture and test flows, see [DESIGN.md](../../docs/design/DESIGN.md), [METRICS.md](../../docs/design/METRICS.md), [TESTING.md](../../docs/design/TESTING.md), [message_protocol.md](../../docs/design/message_protocol.md), and [LLAMA_STAGE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md](../../docs/design/LLAMA_STAGE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md).

## Source layout

The crate root stays intentionally small:

├── inference/             election, launch, pipeline splits, MoE orchestration
├── mesh/                  peer membership, gossip, routing tables, QUIC node behavior
├── models/                catalog, search, GGUF metadata, inventory, resolution
├── network/               proxying, tunnels, affinity, Nostr discovery, endpoint rewrite
├── plugin/                external plugin host, MCP bridge, transport, config

├── runtime/               top-level startup flows and local runtime coordination
└── system/                hardware detection, benchmarking, self-update
```

Notable built-ins under `src/plugins/` today:

├── blackboard/            shared mesh message feed + MCP surface
└── lemonade/              external OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint bridge
```

## Runtime model

- `mesh-llm` owns the user-facing OpenAI-compatible API on `:9337`. Requests are routed by model.
- The management API and web console live on `:3131`. Pass `--headless` to disable the embedded web UI while keeping the management API (`/api/*`) available on that port.
- Dense models that fit run locally. Dense models that do not fit can be split with pipeline parallelism.
- MoE models are handled through expert-aware orchestration in `inference/moe.rs`.
- Routing and demand tracking are mesh-wide. Nodes can serve different models at the same time.
- Discovery is optional and Nostr-backed. Private meshes work with explicit join tokens only.

The control plane uses protocol `mesh-llm/1` with protobuf framing for mesh traffic.

## API surface

The management API exposes the state the UI uses directly:

- `GET /api/status` for node, peer, and routing state, including enriched `gpus[]` hardware entries with per-device VRAM, optional reserved bytes when the backend reports a true reserved/unavailable metric, memory bandwidth, and compute-throughput hints
- `GET /api/events` for live updates
- `GET /api/models` for mesh model inventory and `GET /api/runtime*` for loaded model/process state
- `GET /api/search` for read-only catalog or Hugging Face model search, returning the same JSON payload shape as `mesh-llm models search --json`
- `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE /api/model-interests` for local explicit-interest submission and readback using canonical model refs such as `org/repo@rev:variant`
- `GET /api/model-targets` for ranked model targets derived from explicit interest, active demand, and current serving visibility, with raw `signals` kept separate from derived `target_rank`/`wanted` hints
- `GET /api/discover` for mesh discovery results
- `GET /api/plugins` plus per-plugin tool endpoints
- `GET /api/blackboard/feed`, `GET /api/blackboard/search`, `POST /api/blackboard/post`

The OpenAI-compatible inference API remains on `http://localhost:9337/v1`, including `/v1/models`.

## Plugins and MCP

Plugin hosting now lives in `src/plugin/` rather than a crate-root module. mesh-llm supports:

- built-in plugins shipped with the binary
- external executable plugins declared in `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml`
- MCP exposure through the plugin bridge

`mesh-llm serve` also loads startup model config from the same file. The blackboard plugin is auto-registered unless explicitly disabled in config. Useful entry points:

```bash
mesh-llm plugin list
mesh-llm blackboard
mesh-llm blackboard --search "routing"
mesh-llm client --join <token> blackboard --mcp
```

Unified local config example:

```toml
version = 1

[gpu]
assignment = "pinned"

[[models]]
model = "Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M"
gpu_id = "pci:0000:65:00.0"

[[models]]
model = "bartowski/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-GGUF/qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf"
mmproj = "bartowski/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-GGUF/mmproj-f16.gguf"
ctx_size = 8192
gpu_id = "uuid:GPU-12345678"

[[plugin]]
name = "blackboard"
enabled = true

[[plugin]]
name = "my-plugin"
command = "/absolute/path/to/plugin-binary"
args = ["--stdio"]
```

`mesh-llm serve` uses `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml` by default, or `--config /path/to/config.toml`.
Explicit `--model` or `--gguf` ignores configured `[[models]]`, and explicit `--ctx-size`
overrides configured `ctx_size` for the selected startup models.
Bare `mesh-llm serve` warns, shows help, and exits if `[[models]]` is empty.

When `[gpu].assignment = "pinned"`, every configured `[[models]]` entry must include a `gpu_id` taken from the pinnable stable IDs shown by `mesh-llm gpus` / `mesh-llm gpus --json`. Some fallback `stable_id` values may still be printed for inventory (`index:*`, backend-device names, and similar fallbacks), but those are not valid config identities. Pinned configs fail closed when an ID is missing, ambiguous, unsupported by the selected backend, or no longer resolves on the current host.

## Discovery and mesh modes

Opt-in Nostr discovery:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-3B --publish --mesh-name "Sydney Lab" --region AU
mesh-llm discover
mesh-llm discover --model GLM --region AU
mesh-llm serve --auto
mesh-llm gpus
```

Named meshes still work as a strict discovery filter:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --auto --model GLM-4.7-Flash-Q4_K_M --mesh-name "poker-night"
```

No-arg behavior remains intentionally simple:

```bash
mesh-llm
```

It prints `--help` and exits without binding the console or API ports.

## Development notes

- Build and test from the repo root with `just`; do not invoke ad-hoc build commands.
- Keep new code inside the owning domain module instead of adding new crate-root files.
- When changing protocol behavior, preserve compatibility unless a breaking change is explicitly intended.

## Live demo

**[Try it now](https://mesh-llm-console.fly.dev/)** — web console connected to the default public mesh. Runs as a client on Fly.io, no GPU.
